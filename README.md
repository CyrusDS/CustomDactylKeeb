# Custom Dactyl Keyboard with trackball

<img src=""/>

I've been getting into the small but strong keyboard community, and one sect of the large
community is interested in these types of ergo keyboards. I've never really used or thought
about having one before this project. However, it seemed like a fun project to combine
my current education in College at CU Boulder as well as my own interest in custom keyboards recently.

## Research Beforehand
I had a ton of initial research before even deciding to do this project. One thing that pushed
me over the edge of doing this whole custom project was wanting to have a trackball. Being able to
use a keyboard and a mouse as an all-in-one ergonomic design really sold me on the idea. Or at least,
the challenge and interesting results would hopefully not disappoint.

In the end, I decided to utilize the design provided by the dactl keyboard community 
https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard 
I noticed this was a bit of an older project so I decided to make my own updated version, 
including a different controller board setup and also some new capabilities which required some design retooling.

## Parts List (not fully complete)
As I wanted to update the older project shown above, I opted for some more modern parts, shown below.

## Beginnings designs and Modifications to original model
Initially, the plan was to design a model with a trackpad integrated to the dactyl layout and simply print it. However, 3D Modeling the addition proved to be a time consuming effort and the initial design simply had the trackball too far from ones hands, in order to be ergonomically comfortable. So, I had to re-design the 3D model from scratch again multiple times, before even printing the first design. The first design that actually made the cut to be printed is below

Shown as 3d model only.

Notice that there are slots in the hemisphere to accomodate for bearings to be placed. This is taken as a suggestion from another community member who suggested to include them for smoother trackpad scrolling. Not sure if this will stay on my model, but it does seem worth trying his suggestion.
