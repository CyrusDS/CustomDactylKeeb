# Custom Dactyl Keyboard with trackball

<img src=""/>

I've been getting into the small but strong keyboard community, and one sect of the large
community is interested in these types of ergo keyboards. I've never really used or thought
about having one before this project. However, it seemed like a fun project to combine
my current education in College at CU Boulder as well as my own interest in custom keyboards recently.

## Research Beforehand
I had a ton of initial research before even deciding to do this project. One thing that pushed
me over the edge of doing this whole custom project was wanting to have a trackball. Being able to
use a keyboard and a mouse as an all-in-one ergonomic design really sold me on the idea. Or at least,
the challenge and interesting results would hopefully not disappoint.

In the end, I decided to utilize the design provided by the dactl keyboard community 
https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard 
I noticed this was a bit of an older project so I decided to make my own updated version, 
including a different controller board setup and also some new capabilities which required some design retooling.
